## Future Improvements

I used the DDPG algorithm to solve this problem which has the benefit of being more simple to understand and code but it does not allow individual agents to learn on their own and thus wastes some of the potential of the 20 arm environment.

Algorithms like PPO, A3C, and D4PG that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience would be a really interesting future improvement to this project.
