## Background Information
For this Project I built a deep reinforcement learning model to train an robotic arm to track a target location. Visually the task is achieved when the darker blue ball is touching the bright green 'target' ball.

## After Training

As you can see after training the model achieves pretty good results and is able to track the target in most instances. Part of what makes this a non trivial problem is that there are many different speeds and directions that the target may move.
